# ShowingGoodMovies

Welcome, after downloading, please remember to install pods before running

This is a cool little app for searching movie database as well as showing the popular movies upon starting the project

MVVM architecture is implemented for a better, simple looking viewController. 
Although coordinator pattern may be used, for a single page data transfer, I chose to use segue for showing data on detail page.

Thank you and enjoy.
